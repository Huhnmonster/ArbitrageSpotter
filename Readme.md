This is not ready for anything

This has been an experiment but is very likely to not work anymore, since exchanges have changed their apis. Feel free to fork this at any point.

What is this?
---
ArbitrageSpotter is a terminal script that checks crypto currencies across different exchanges and notifies the user 
whenever a predetermined threshold of percentual difference is reached. It currently checks Bitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX (Now Coinbase Pro) and Cryptopia.

How does it work?
---
You just install all dependencies and run it. That's all :D
It will then poll exchanges every 30 seconds and show mispriced assets on different exchanges
