ArbitrageSpotter is a terminal script that checks crypto currencies across different exchanges and notifies the user 
whenever a predetermined threshold of percentual difference is reached. It currently checks Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Gdax
and Cryptopia but more exchanges are being added.

Todo:

- Add threaded routine for quicker data polling
- Add config file to change certain threshold and time values
- Add logging capability
- Add a way to measure stability of a possible Arbitrage opportunity
- Add error handlers
